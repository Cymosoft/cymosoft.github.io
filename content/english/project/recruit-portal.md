We had the pleasure of working with a client based in Japan, for whom we provided system design and delivery services. To ensure optimal results, we utilized the highly efficient and reliable tools of AWS and Docker, which allowed us to streamline the development process and deliver a top-notch product.

Our team of skilled professionals worked tirelessly to ensure that the project was completed on time, with the final product being delivered on May 1st, 2021. We utilized our diverse range of skills, including AWS, PHP, HTML5, TypeScript, and CSS3 to deliver a system that was not only functional but also had an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.

Our team leveraged AWS to create a scalable and reliable system that could handle any future needs of the client. Docker was utilized to ensure that the system was delivered seamlessly and efficiently, reducing the time required for deployment and minimizing any potential errors.

With our expertise and the tools we had at our disposal, we were able to deliver a high-quality product that met the client's requirements and exceeded their expectations.
