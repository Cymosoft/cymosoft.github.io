The client we worked with was based in Japan and our project involved system design and delivery. To accomplish this task, we utilized the AWS and Docker tools, which helped us to efficiently manage and deploy the project. Our team of experts worked diligently to meet all the requirements and expectations of the client.

To accomplish this task, we relied on our diverse set of skills, including AWS, RAILS, HTML5, TypeScript, and CSS3. These skills allowed us to develop a robust and reliable system, with an intuitive user interface and a seamless user experience. By leveraging these tools and our expertise, we were able to deliver a high-quality product that exceeded the client's expectations.
