Our project involved designing and delivering a system that provides estimating results for construction materials for a Japanese client. Our team of skilled professionals worked diligently to ensure that the system was tailored to the client's specific needs and requirements.

To accomplish this, we utilized AWS and Vscode as our primary tools, which helped us to develop and deploy the system in a highly efficient and scalable manner. Our team relied on their extensive knowledge and experience in JAVA and ANGULAR programming languages to develop a system that is not only highly functional but also user-friendly and visually appealing.

Our team took a data-driven approach to designing the system, utilizing various algorithms and data models to ensure that the estimating results provided were highly accurate and reliable. We also ensured that the system was highly scalable and could handle large volumes of data and user traffic.

The final product was met all of their requirements and expectations. The use of AWS ensured that the system was highly secure and reliable, while the use of Vscode made it easy for the client to modify and customize the system as needed.

Overall, our project resulted in a highly functional and efficient system that provides accurate and reliable estimating results for construction materials, allowing our client to make informed decisions and operate more efficiently in their industry.
